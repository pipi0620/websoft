        <p>My name is LINGJIA CHEN, I was born in Zhejiang, China, which is one of the cradles of Chinese civilization.</p>

        <p>I like listening to music. When I was young, I dreamed of becoming a singer. Obviously, this is impossible</p>

        <p>My main task now is to complete my studies and then improve my coding skills</p>

        <p>However, I'm not interseted at programming.I regret not studying it well</p>

        <p>I won't motivate myself to say that you still have time and you can learn them. I know very well that I am lazy.</p>

        <p>Practice makes perfect!</p>

        <p>Lets keep in touch in the chatt and through GitHub!</p>
