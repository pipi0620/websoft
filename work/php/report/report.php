<h2>S01</h2>
<p>1.Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?<br>
    In the software engineering class last semester,
    we used GitHub to collaborate on a project.
    So to some extent, I am familiar with it. But I know nothing about MarkDown.</p>
   <p> 2.Have you ever created websites before?<br>
I created a website with my classmates when I was a freshman.
But we did it particularly badly. We downloaded a template on a website,
       and then made changes to various parts based on what we learned.</p>
   <p> 3.Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.<br>
       Just distinguish web application from web service. It display in HTML.</p>
   <p> 4.TIL:First of all, I think I learned to perform code operations in the terminal, and then I awakened my previous knowledge.
That's all.</p>
</section>

<p>
<h2>S02</h2>
<p>1.Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?<br>
    I had experience in HTML before, but I have almost forgotten my knowledge now.</p>
    <p>2.Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.<br>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML is a language used to describe web pages;</li>
        <li>CSS controlling how HTML elements are displayed;</li>
        <li>JavaScript does not require script code to be compiled,
            and can be directly interpreted and executed in a browser or JS container.</li>
</ul>
    In pages:
    <ul>
        <li>HTML definition structure</li>
        <li>CSS control display style</li>
        <li>JavaScript adds various operations and interactions to the page</li>
    </ul></p>

  <p>3.Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.<br>
      The browser and the web server interacts through HTTP protocol.The client requests the server based on the address information entered by the user, and the server processes the request after receiving the user's request.
      The processing result is then returned to the client, and the client displays the response result to the user.
</p>
    <p>4.TIL: Through the past few days of learning, I got started very smoothly.
    I am more proficient in Git terminal operations than before,
    and I deliberately learned some basic UNIX commands.</p>

<section>
<h2>S03</h2>
<p>1.Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?<br>
    I have no previous experience of client side JavaScript. JS is new for me. </p>
    <p>2.Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?<br>
        Python and Javascript both require an interpreter to run,
    both are dynamically typed.However, they are also very different.
    At the beginning of the design of Javascript was a client-side scripting language,
    mainly a syntax browser, and its syntax was mainly in C.
    Python is widely welcomed into different scenarios such as education,
        scientific computing, web development.</p>
<p>3.Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?<br>
    For coding exercise, I watch your video on YOUTUBE and learn some basic knowledge from website.
    I decide to complete the requirement for grade 3 first.</p>
<p>4.TIL：JavaScript is hard for me.
    I need to spend more time on it since our project use JS.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S04</h2>
<p>1.Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.<br>
    I have no previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</p>
<P>2.How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?<br>
    Working with JavaScript, Node and Express is tough.
    But you give us a very detailed explanation on web page.
    So I am able to quickly get into study in a limited learning time.</P>
    <p>3.Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?<br>
        Before I do the assignment, I will do your exercises first,
        and when come across the point I don’t know, I will search it first.
        My plan is to learn JavaScript first, so that I can better perform assignment and project</p>
<p>4.What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?<br>
    I am aim for grade 4, and it's a little difficult for me.</p>
    <p>5.TIL: npm init --yes generates a package.json file.A response object (usually passed to a callback method, which means you can name it whatever you want, usually res, resp or
        response) The life cycle begins with an instance of the Node core object http.ServerResponse</p>

<h2>S05</h2>
<p>1. How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?<br>
    As for this question, I might say I prefer JavaScript.</p>
    <p>2.Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?<br>
        PHP is a server scripting language that interprets and executes. First of all,
        PHP has the characteristics of simple and easy to use. The syntax is similar to C language,
        so programmers who have learned C language can quickly become familiar with PHP development.
        To learn java, you must first learn the syntax of java and be familiar with some core class libraries,
        and understand object-oriented programming methods. So java is not as easy to learn as php.<br></p>
       <p> 3.Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?<br>
           A bad thing: I even don't know how to connect git to mysql. Just seek for friend's help. I am aim for grade 3 and that's enough.
           PHP is more complex than I thought.</p>
        <p>4.TIL:I learned how to update html document to php document. And of course, use PHP to do search on database.

<h2>S06</h2>
<p>1.What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?<br>
    We need those programming languages to motivate our life.
    In the future, they will make our life more intelligent and more convenient. We need them.</p>
    <p>2.What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?<br>
        Maybe JS. To be honest, I am not proficient in any language. But JS really appeals to me.</p>
<p>3.Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com (Links to an external site.) to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results.<br>
    I made a comparison between TensorFlow and Keras. It shows that Keras is more popular than TensorFlow within the globe In all categories.
    But it seems that TensorFlow is more popular in the computer science.
</p>
<p>4.If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?<br>
    It should be TensorFlow. I would recommend like this: it is not only portable and efficient, but also can run on different computers:
    from smartphones to computer clusters;
    it is widely used in different groups from individuals to businesses, from startups to large companies.
</p><p>
5.TIL:We should keep up with the trend of the times and choose a language suitable for survival in the future.</p>

<p>2.TIL:When we create our own website, we can refer to the advantages and disadvantages of existing websites such as kicks,
    so that our website can perform better.</p>
</section>

<p>
<h2>S09</h2>
    1.Elaborate on a few (3-5) different security issues or concerns, from your own experience, related to web application security and relate them to the OWASP top ten.<br>
       <ul>
    <li>insecure deserialization<p>Google Chrome now has provide users with strong encryption password when creating a new account.
    It can prevent user from external attackers.</p></li>
    <li>insufficient logging and monitoring<p>When we have a strong monitoring function,
        we can quickly view the web traffic statistics and see if an exception has occurred in the system.</p></li>
    <li>cross-site scripting xss<p>Sometimes when we enter certain webpages, the browser will remind us that the webpage may be at risk.
        This is because a malicious attacker inserts malicious html code into a web page. When a user browses the page, the html code embedded in the web will be executed,
        thereby achieving the special purpose of the malicious user.</p></li>

    </ul>

        2.Summarize by providing your own guidelines to a new web programmer on the topic “The essential guidelines to follow to create secure web applications”.
    <ul>
        <li>Never store unfiltered user input in the database.</li>
        <li>Do not create SQL statements by concatenating strings involving user input.</li>
        <li>Use Secure Sockets Layer to save sensitive information.</li>
        <li>Do not store any critical information in cookies.Never store unfiltered user input in the database.</li>
    </ul>

   <p> 3.TIL: With the development of network technology,
    web application has developed rapidly. However,
    security issues have become increasingly prominent. We need to focus on these security issues</p>
