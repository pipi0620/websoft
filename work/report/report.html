<h2>S01</h2>
<p>In the software engineering class last semester, we used GitHub to collaborate on a project. So to some extent, I am familiar with it. But I know nothing about MarkDown.
I created a website with my classmates when I was a freshman. 
But we did it particularly badly. We downloaded a template on a website, and then made changes to various parts based on what we learned. 
For what I have learned about TIL, first of all, I think I learned to perform code operations in the terminal, and then I awakened my previous knowledge.
That's all.</p>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p>I had experience in HTML before, but I have almost forgotten my knowledge now.HTML is a language used to describe web pages;CSS controlling how HTML elements are displayed;JavaScript does not require script code to be compiled, and can be directly interpreted and executed in a browser or JS container.
In the page:HTML definition structure;CSS control display style;JavaScript adds various operations and interactions to the page.TIL: Through the past few days of learning, I got started very smoothly.I am more proficient in Git terminal operations than before, and I deliberately learned some basic UNIX commands.</p>

<p>1.I have no previous experience of client side JavaScript.
    JS is new for me. 2.Python and Javascript both require an interpreter to run,
    both are dynamically typed, both support automatic memory management,
    and both can call eval () to execute scripts and other features common to scripting languages.
    However, they are also very different.
    At the beginning of the design of Javascript was a client-side scripting language,
    mainly a syntax browser, and its syntax was mainly in C.
    Python is widely welcomed into different scenarios such as education,
    scientific computing, web development.
3.For coding exercise, I watch your vedio on YOUTUBE and learn some basic knowledge from website.
I decide to complete the requirement for grade 3 first.
4.as for TIL, JavaScript is hard for me. I need to spend more time on it since our project use JS.</p>

<h2>S04</h2>
<p>1.I have no previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</p>
<P>2.Working with JavaScript, Node and Express is tough. But you give us a very detailed explanation on web page.So I am able to quickly get into study in a limited learning time.</P>
    <p>Before I do the assignment, I will do your exercises first, and if I come across the point I donâ€™t know, I will search it first.
        My plan is to learn JavaScript first, so that I can better perform assignment and project</p>
<p>I am aim for grade 4, and it's a little difficult for me.</p>
    <p>TIL: npm init --yes generates a package.json file.A response object (usually passed to a callback method, which means you can name it whatever you want, usually res, resp or
        response) The life cycle begins with an instance of the Node core object http.ServerResponse</p>
